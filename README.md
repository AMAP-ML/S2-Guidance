## üî• Updates
- **[2023/12]** Our paper is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01323) and the [project page](https://chubin-chen.github.io/S2-Guidance/) is live!
- **[Coming Soon]** Code models will be released soon.

##  Showcase
Here are some examples comparing the results from standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) with our **S¬≤-Guidance**. Our method consistently produces higher-fidelity and more coherent results for both images and videos.

**Prompt:** "A floating castle above the clouds, with 'S¬≤ Guidance Is All You Need' swirling in the mist."

## üìñ Abstract
> Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique in modern diffusion models for enhancing sample quality and prompt adherence. However, through an empirical analysis on Gaussian mixture modeling with a closed-form solution, we observe a discrepancy between the suboptimal results produced by CFG and the ground truth. The model's excessive reliance on these suboptimal predictions often leads to semantic incoherence and low-quality outputs. To address this issue, we first empirically demonstrate that the model's suboptimal predictions can be effectively refined using sub-networks of the model itself. Building on this insight, we propose **S¬≤-Guidance**, a novel method that leverages stochastic block-dropping during the forward process to construct sub-networks, effectively guiding the model away from potential low-quality predictions and toward high-quality outputs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation tasks demonstrate that **S¬≤-Guidance** delivers superior performance, consistently surpassing CFG and other advanced guidance strategies.
